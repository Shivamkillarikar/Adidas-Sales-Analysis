# **Adidas Sales Data Analysis Project**

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for performing an in-depth analysis of a sales dataset for Adidas. The dataset contains sales data across various dimensions like products, regions, dates, and sales methods. The goal was to extract actionable insights from the data and perform key analyses such as identifying top-performing products, analyzing trends, and calculating state-wise and method-wise performance.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Identify Top-Performing Products**:
   - Determine the top 3 best-selling products by total sales.
   - Identify products generating the highest and second-highest operating profits.

2. **Rank Products by Sales and Profits**:
   - Use SQL window functions (`RANK()`) to rank products based on their total sales and operating profits.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Perform month-wise and year-wise analysis of sales and profits to identify seasonal trends.
   - Quantify the percentage contribution of each sales method to overall sales and profits.

4. **State-Wise and Product-Wise Analysis**:
   - Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each product in every state.
   - Identify states with the lowest profits and quantify their contribution.

5. **Advanced Queries Using SQL Techniques**:
   - Utilize **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to calculate the monthly and overall percentage contributions of products.
   - Apply **window functions** like `LAG`, `LEAD`, and `RANK` for comparative and trend analysis.

---

## **Key SQL Queries**

### 1. **Top 3 Selling Products**
This query identifies the products with the highest total sales:
```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Total_Sales) AS Sales
FROM adidasUS
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Sales DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

** OUTPUT :
Men's Street Footwear	208826244

Women's Apparel	179038860

Men's Athletic Footwear	153673680 
**



### 2. **Second Highest Operating Profit**
Find the product with the second-highest operating profit using a subquery:
```sql
SELECT Product, MAX(Operating_Profit) AS MAXIMUM_PROFIT
FROM adidasUS
WHERE Operating_Profit < (SELECT MAX(Operating_Profit) FROM adidasUS)
GROUP BY Product
LIMIT 1;
```

** OUTPUT : 

Men's Street Footwear	382500 
**


### 3. **Rank Products by Sales and Profits**
Rank products by their total sales and profits using the `RANK()` window function:
```sql
SELECT 
    Product,
    SUM(Total_Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Operating_Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Total_Sales) DESC) AS Sale_Rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Operating_Profit) DESC ) AS Profit_Rank
FROM adidasUS
GROUP BY Product;
```
**OUTPUT : 
Women's Apparel	179038860	68650996	2	2

Men's Athletic Footwear	153673680	51846964	3	3

Women's Street Footwear	128002813	45095897	4	4

Men's Apparel	123728632	44763099	5	5

Women's Athletic Footwear	106631896	38975843	6	6
**

### 4. **Month-Wise Sales & Profits**
Extract the month from a date column stored as text and calculate sales and profits:
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(Invoice_Date, '%d-%m-%Y'), '%b') AS month,
    SUM(Total_Sales) AS TOTAL_SALES,
    SUM(Operating_Profit) AS TOTAL_PROFITS
FROM adidasUS
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT('01-', month, '-2020'), '%d-%b-%Y');
```

**OUTPUT : 

Jan	71479142	25141970

Feb	61100153	21392765

Mar	56809109	20439808

Apr	72339970	27559278

May	80507695	29946287

Jun	74747372	26714734

Nov	67857340	24755550

Dec	85841957	31590236
**

### 5. **Which sales method produced highest amount of sales,profits**
```sql
select sales_method,sum(total_sales) as total_sales,
sum(operating_profit) as profits ,
sum(total_sales) * 100/(select sum(total_sales) from adidasUS) as percentage_of_sales,
sum(operating_profit)*100/(select sum(operating_profit) from adidasUS) as percentage_of_profits
from adidasUS
group by sales_method;
```
**OUTPUT : 

In-store	356643750	127591382	39.6314	38.4155

Outlet	295585493	107988403	32.8464	32.5134

Online	247672882	96555337	27.5222	29.0711
**


### 7. **Percentage sales of each product state wise**
```sql
select state,product,sum(total_sales)*100/(select sum(total_sales) from adidasUS ) as percentage_of_sales
from adidasUS
group by state,product;
```

# Adidas Sales Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Adidas US sales dataset. It utilizes Python for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights and trends. The dataset includes sales records for various regions, states, and products across different sales methods.
